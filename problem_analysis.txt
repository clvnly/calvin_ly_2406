19. The company currently receives orders via e-mail, which contains customer information and payment information. A person must check each individual order if
the payment was successful. Under this current system, order information is prone to error, and difficult to process.
The massive amount of order requests via e-mails is also cumbersome to process, there is no sorting system in place. Additional manpower is required to individually check
each order if the customer payment was successful; this dramatically slows down the speed of processing orders.
This system is also not popular among customers, as they have voiced concerns about security and vulnerability.
Customers also want an online account system to make it easier to request deliveries and to save information about previous deliveries.

20. System improvement objectives:
(1) Greatly speed up the time in which orders are processed.
(2)Reduce the amount of incomplete orders.
(3)Increase customer trust and satisfaction with the delivery request process. This will be tracked via customer surveys before and after the system is implemented.
